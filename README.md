1. Add arithmetic operators (add, subtract, multiply, divide) to make the following expressions true. You can use any parentheses youâ€™d like.

`((3 + 1)/ 3) * 9 = 12`

2. Write a function/method utilizing Swift to determine whether two strings are anagrams or not (examples of anagrams: debit card/bad credit, ~~punishments/nine thumps~~, etc.)

  according to anagram definition:
  > both strings must contain the same exact letters in the same exact frequency

nine thumps is not anagrams of punishments. because it has only **one** `s` character. while punishments has **two** `s`

```swift
func checkAnagrams(string1: String, string2: String) -> Bool {
   
    // first remove white space and newlines
    let string1 = string1.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines).replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "")
    let string2 = string2.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines).replacingOccurrences(of: " ", with: "")
  
    // second rule of being anagrams is having equal length
    guard string2.count == string1.count else {
        return false
    }
    
    var mainStringCharDic = [Character: Int]()
    
    string1.forEach { char in
        if mainStringCharDic[char] == nil {
            mainStringCharDic[char] = 1
        } else {
            mainStringCharDic[char]! += 1
        }
    }
    
    for char in string2 {
        if mainStringCharDic[char] == nil {
            return false
        } else {
            let charCount = mainStringCharDic[char]!
            if charCount == 1 {
                mainStringCharDic[char] = nil
            } else {
                mainStringCharDic[char]! = charCount - 1
            }
        }
    }
   
    return mainStringCharDic.count == 0 ?  true :  false
}
```

3. Write a method in Swift to generate the nth Fibonacci number (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34) 

A. recursive approach

```swift
func recuresiveFibonacci(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    
    guard number > 2 else {
        return 1
    }
    
    return recuresiveFibonacci(number - 1) + recuresiveFibonacci(number - 2)
}
```

B. iterative approach

```swift
func iterativeFibonacci(_ number: Int) -> Int {
    
    guard number > 2 else {
        return 1
    }
    
    var fibNminus2 = 1
    var fibNminus1 = 1
    
    var fibonacci = 0
    var counter = 3
    
    while counter <= number {
        fibonacci = fibNminus1 + fibNminus2
        
        fibNminus2 = fibNminus1
        fibNminus1 = fibonacci
        
        counter += 1
    }
    
    return fibonacci
}
```

4. Which architecture would you use for the required task below? Why?
This Project is developed based on modular design, a software design technique that emphasizes separating the functionality of a program into independent, interchangeable modules, such that each one contains everything necessary to execute only one aspect of the desired functionality

**Business reasons**
1. The company requires that parts of the codebase are reused and shared across projects, products, and teams
2. The company requires multiple products to be unified into a single one.

**Tech reasons**
1. It helps the teams to work in parallel without defining any bottlenecks and removes dependency
2. maintaining the code base becomes much easier as each module only contains the necessary code to run specific functionality
3. Increase development speed and independency and teams satisfaction
4. Each module can developed with with its own code style and presentation architectures
5. Enables port functionalities across projects/products and increases resuability.
